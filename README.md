# PSF generation

## Introduction
------------
Point Spread Function(PSF) is an important function in optics, especially in camera design. Point spread function can be generated using commercial tools like Zemax or CodeV. 
This project aims to duplicate the function of those tools using a neural network especially, CNN. 
The inputs are the lens parameters and outputs are the PSFs for three field of views (FOV).
